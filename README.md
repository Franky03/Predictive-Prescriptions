# Predictive Prescription Repository

The main goal of this repository is to explore how machine learning can be applied not only to predict outcomes but also to make optimal decisions under uncertainty. By integrating predictions with optimization techniques, we aim to move beyond traditional predictive analytics to the realm of prescriptive analytics.

This repository was implemented by me, with the help of some code references inspired by the article "From Predictive to Prescriptive Analytics" by Dimitris Bertsimas.
