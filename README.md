# Predictive Prescription Repository

The main goal of this repository is to explore how machine learning can be applied not only to predict outcomes but also to make optimal decisions under uncertainty. By integrating predictions with optimization techniques, we aim to move beyond traditional predictive analytics to the realm of prescriptive analytics.

The first problem studied in this repository is the two-stage shipment problem described by Dimitris Bertsimas in his seminal paper:
"From Predictive to Prescriptive Analytics".
